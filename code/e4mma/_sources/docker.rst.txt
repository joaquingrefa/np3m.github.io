EOS with Docker
===============

(Experimental)

To run the code in a docker container you need to run::

  docker build - < dockerfile

Currently the code reads the EOS table and depending on the baryon
density :math:`n_B`, electron fraction :math:`Y_e` and temperature
:math:`T` computes various nuclear properties.
