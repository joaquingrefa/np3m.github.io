              Title: Constraining the Neutron Star EOS with quasiperiodic
              oscillations from short GRBs<br>
            </p>
            <p>
              Abstract: Gamma ray bursts (GRBs) are the most luminous
              electromagnetic events in the universe. Short GRBs,
              typically lasting less than 2 seconds, have already been
              associated with binary neutron star (BNS) mergers, which
              are also sources of gravitational waves (GWs). The
              ultimate fate of a BNS, after coalescence, is usually
              expected to be a black hole (BH) with 2-3 solar masses.
              However, numerical relativity simulations indicate the
              possible formation of a short-lived hypermassive neutron
              star (HMNS), lasting for tens to hundreds of
              milliseconds after the BNS merger and before
              gravitational collapse forms a BH. The HMNS is expected
              to emit GWs with kHz frequencies that will be detectable
              by third generation ground-based GW detectors in the
              2030s. I will present results from a recent analysis
              that revealed evidence for HMNSs by looking for kHz
              quasiperiodic oscillations in gamma-ray observations
              obtained in the 1990s with the Compton Gamma Ray
              Observatory.

              Title: Core Collapse Supernovae and EOS thermal effects
            </p>
            <p>
              Abstract: Core-collapse supernovae (like mergers, the
              focus area of NP3M), are astrophysical sites rich with
              extreme physics and multimessenger signals. In this
              seminar I'll give a brief introduction to supernovae and
              the multimessenger signals expected from them. I'll also
              discuss in more detail our recent investigations into
              the impact of the thermal dependence in the nuclear
              equation of state in core-collapse supernova
              simulations, including the impact on the neutrino and
              gravitational wave signal, black hole formation
              properties, and the impact on potential ejecta from
              failed supernovae.

              Title: Effect of Missing Physics on Tests of General
              Relativity with Gravitational Waves
            </p>
            <p>
              Abstract: The observation of gravitational waves has
              enabled us to carry out stringent tests of Einstein's
              general theory of relativity (GR) in previously
              inaccessible regions of strong gravity. No violation of
              GR has been found so far but the improved detector
              sensitivity will detect binaries in configurations which
              are never seen before and may reveal features that are
              different from GR. There were a couple of events in
              GWTC-3 that showed hints of GR deviation though further
              investigations are needed since the deviation could be
              due to the use of imperfect waveform models or poorly
              understood noise artifacts in the data. In this talk, I
              will discuss various causes that could potentially lead
              to a false GR violation and what we can do to mitigate
              them. I'll also show results from our recent study on
              the effect of missing eccentricity on tests of GR and
              how it led to false GR violations. The gravitational
              wave community has to exclude the possibility of such
              causes (like an eccentric binary) in order to make any
              claim of a GR violation. </p>

              Title: Impact of moment-based, energy integrated
              neutrino transport on microphysics and ejecta in binary
              neutron star mergers
            </p>
            <p>
              Abstract: We present an extensive study of the effects
              of neutrino transport in 3-dimensional general
              relativistic radiation hydrodynamics (GRHD) simulations
              of binary neutron star (BNS) mergers using our
              moment-based, energy-integrated neutrino radiation
              transport (M1) scheme. We consider a total of 8 BNS
              configurations, while varying equation of state models,
              mass ratios and grid resolutions, for a total of 16
              simulations. We find that M1 neutrino transport is
              crucial in modeling the local absorption of neutrinos
              and the deposition of lepton number throughout the
              medium. We provide an in-depth look at the effects of
              neutrinos on the fluid dynamics and luminosity during
              the late inspiral and post-merger phases,
              out-of-equilibrium dynamics and the potential impact of
              neutrino absorption on mitigating bulk viscosity in the
              post-merger phase, the properties of ejecta and outflow,
              and the post-merger nucleosynthesis.
