        <h1>NP3M Code of Conduct</h1>

        <p>
          All participants in NP3M activities must conduct themselves
          in a professional manner that is welcoming to all
          participants and free from any form of discrimination,
          harassment, or retaliation. All participants are expected to
          treat each other with respect and consideration, creating a
          collegial, inclusive, and professional environment for our
          activities.
        </p>

        <p>
          Specifically, participants will avoid any inappropriate
          actions or statements based on individual characteristics
          including age, race, ethnicity, sexual orientation, gender
          identity, gender expression, ability status, marital status,
          nationality, political affiliation, religion, immigration
          status, and educational background. Harassment includes but
          is not limited to inappropriate or intimidating behavior and
          language, unwelcome jokes or comments, unwanted touching or
          attention, photography without permission, sharing offensive
          images, and stalking.
        </p>

        <p>
          If a participant observes inappropriate comments or actions
          and personal intervention seems appropriate and safe, they
          should be considerate of all parties when intervening. In
          all cases, a participant observing violations of this code
          of conduct has a responsibility to report the violation to
          NP3M leadership, for appropriate action. Retaliation for
          complaints of inappropriate conduct will not be tolerated.
        </p>
