              <h4>Characterizing a supernovaâ€™s standing accretion
                shock instability with neutrinos and gravitational
                waves: Zidu Lin, Abhinav Rijal, Cecilia Lunardini,

            </p>
            <p>Our work is inspired by the fact that both neutrino and
              GW signals are sensitive to the properties of CCSNe matter
              in the inner region of the star. Given the huge progress
              made in detection technologies in both neutrino and GW
              channels, it is very likely that the next galactic CCSN
              will be observed by our next-generation neutrino as well
              as GW telescopes with unprecedented details. Consequently,
              it is natural to ask: what physics about a CCSN can be
              learnt by jointly analyzing the neutrino and the GW
              signals from this dying massive star?
            </p>
            <p>This paper proposes a multi-messenger approach for
              studying supernovae. The galactic CCSNe events are rare,
              and it is almost an obligation that we extract the
              astrophysical information as much as we can from a future
              observation of galactic CCSN. The multi-messenger
              approaches can help us to better achieve this goal.
              Briefly speaking, in this work we propose a method that
              can help scientists to understand a complex hydrodynamical
              phenomenon, the Standing Accretion Shock Instability
              (SASI), in a more comprehensive way by jointly analyzing
              future neutrino and GW signals from CCSNe.
            </p>
            <p>There are still many unclear physics aspects about the
              inner region of CCSNe. For example, the descriptions of
              hydrodynamics, neutrino transport, and properties of
              dense matter in CCSNe are all highly model-dependent.
              However, there are currently only a few observables that
              we can use to verify our theories about CCSNe. The
              traditional single-messenger method may not be powerful
              enough to test these theories. One specific example is
              the relationship between the frequency of the SASI in
              the neutrino signal and the GW signal. A multi-messenger
              analysis might lift the "degeneracy" of CCSNe models and
              can help us to more efficiently validate the prediction
              of SASI activity against future neutrino and GW signals.
              The method we propose might be one of a few
              multi-messenger approaches that can quantitatively
              analyze the features of the predicted SASI activity in
              CCSNe. What's more, our study suggests that this
              multi-messenger method may increase the detectability of
              SASI activities in a galactic CCSN comparing to
              traditional single-messenger analysis.
            </p>
            <p>We hope our work will raise the interest in
              multi-messenger analysis for core collapse supernovae,
              which is a relatively new field comparing to the highly
              aware multi-messenger analysis for coalescing binary
              systems. The results of this paper may inspire more
              studies about multi-messenger analysis of CCSNe using
              neutrino and GW signals. What's more, the method
              proposed by this paper provides a systematic and
              quantitative way to compare predictions from our CCSNe
              theories with the future observables from galactic
              CCSNe.</p>
