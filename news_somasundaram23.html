              Einstein’s theory of gravity tells us that when matter
              is compressed beyond a certain density, it collapses
              into a black hole: extraordinary regions of space-time
              from which no information can escape. However, what
              happens to matter that is on the verge of such a
              collapse? What is it made of? In other words, what is
              the nature of the densest matter that can exist in the
              universe? That is the question we have explored in this
              paper by looking at neutron stars: the dead remnants of
              certain massive stars that harbor such dense matter in
              their cores.

              It is possible that matter in the inner cores of neutron
              stars is made up of just protons and neutrons
              (collectively called nucleons), i.e. not too different
              from what makes up nuclei that we have on Earth.
              However, it is possible that at such high densities,
              nucleons disintegrate into their constituent particles
              called quarks. Therefore, to see what such matter is
              really made of, we calculated how fast sound waves
              propagate inside neutron stars. It turns out that sound
              travels faster in nucleonic matter and therefore small
              sound speeds could be evidence of quark matter. Our
              calculations revealed that present theoretical models
              and the experimental data that we have on neutron stars
              are not conclusive regarding the constituents of dense
              matter. However, as we show in the paper, with both
              theoretical and experimental advances expected soon, we
              will be able to discern the nature of such dense matter
              in the near future. So stay tuned!
